Hey, I go by BwE on the internet. I've been into cybersecurity since 2000, and have since began studying it at a PhD level (Good Idea? Not Sure). I've always been interested in reverse engineering, and combined with my interest for repairing random things, I started a small business repairing PlayStation consoles. From there, I began developing open-source software to aid in the repair and reverse engineering of the PS3, PS4, and now PS5.
<br><br>
I've since stopped doing repairs since around 2022 due to a poor pay-to-satisfaction ratio. Now, I focus on developing my own paid software and have since become the global leader in PlayStation repair software. I support tens of thousands of users in countries all around the world and play a part in the repair of 18,000 consoles a week (as of 29th July 2024). Not bad considering I originally made all of my software for my own repairs.
<br><br>
Some people haven't liked the idea of me charging money for repair software (or even protecting it against piracy), but hey that's life. I will continue to do what I enjoy regardless. <3
